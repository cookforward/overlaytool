# OverlayTool

## Overview

Overlay Tool is a powerful batch processing tool designed to overlay video A on top of video B. It offers two methods for combining videos: matching similar names from two folders to create an equal number of output video files or randomly mixing and matching to generate an unlimited number of files based on the source videos.

This tool is a contribution to the Python community and serves as a demonstration within the WWBOT batch video processing program.
